# Building and testing this repo

This repo uses gulp for its build process.

```sh
gulp build
```

This generates the public library files (in the `dist`
folder).

```sh
gulp spec
```

This runs the tests in the `spec` folder. They are
written in Jasmine.

The other gulp tasks are used internally.
